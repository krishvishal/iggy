//! Shard-local message bus with two wire planes.
//!
//! # Plane split
//!
//! - **Replica plane (TCP forever)**: VSR consensus traffic between
//!   replicas. Implemented in [`replica::listener`], [`connector`], and
//!   [`replica::io`]. Datagram or gateway-terminated transports are NOT
//!   supported here and never will be — see
//!   `replica::listener`'s module docs for the rationale.
//! - **SDK-client plane**: ephemeral client connections. Available
//!   transports: TCP, TCP-TLS, WebSocket, WSS, QUIC. Each request
//!   carries a `(client: u128, request: u64)` pair in `RequestHeader`;
//!   downstream consumers in `core/server-ng` are free to use it for
//!   tracing, idempotency, or correlation.
//!
//! # Auth
//!
//! Neither plane is authenticated at the bus layer. Both connect first
//! and let the caller (`core/server-ng`) gate command access via
//! application-level LOGIN commands:
//!
//! - SDK-client plane: `LOGIN_USER` / `LOGIN_WITH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
//!   pre-LOGIN allowlist `PING`, `LOGIN_USER`, `LOGIN_WITH_PAT`.
//! - Replica plane: a future `LOGIN_REPLICA` command carries the
//!   cluster's shared secret. Until that command succeeds the caller
//!   MUST NOT honor consensus messages from the connection. The
//!   `Ping` frame at connect time announces `replica_id` and
//!   `cluster_id` (the listener checks `cluster_id` matches the local
//!   cluster and uses `replica_id` to key its registry); it carries
//!   no MAC.
//!
//! # Invariants worth naming
//!
//! - [`send_to_client`](IggyMessageBus::send_to_client) and
//!   [`send_to_replica`](IggyMessageBus::send_to_replica) return
//!   `Ready` on first poll. Consensus code relies on this for
//!   reentrancy reasoning; any `.await` in the body breaks it.
//! - The TCP transport's writer task coalesces up to
//!   `MessageBusConfig::max_batch` (default 256) `Frozen<MESSAGE_ALIGN>`
//!   into one `write_vectored_all`. Don't introduce per-message
//!   syscalls or per-message encryption on the plaintext TCP plane.
//! - fd-delegation ([`fd_transfer`]) is TCP-only. TLS / QUIC
//!   connections have no dupable plaintext fd, so shard 0 terminates
//!   and forwards `Frozen<MESSAGE_ALIGN>` over the existing
//!   inter-shard flume.
//! - 0-RTT stays disabled by default on any future QUIC path. Per-
//!   command opt-in requires a checked-in idempotence audit.
//!
//! # Transport abstraction
//!
//! [`transports`] defines the trait surface every wire plane sits
//! behind: [`transports::TransportListener`] and
//! [`transports::TransportConn`] with its single
//! [`transports::TransportConn::run`] entry point.
//! [`installer::install_replica_conn`] /
//! [`installer::install_client_conn`] are generic over it so every
//! transport (TCP, TCP-TLS, WS, WSS, QUIC) plugs in behind the same
//! registry, fencing, and dispatch logic.
