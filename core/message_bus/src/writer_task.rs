//! Per-connection writer task.
//!
//! Drains the per-peer mpsc and writes batched consensus frames in a single
//! `writev` syscall via `compio::io::AsyncWriteExt::write_vectored_all`.
//!
//! Single-producer (the bus `send_to_*` path) -> single-consumer (this task),
//! per peer. The mpsc bound provides backpressure: callers `try_send` and
//! receive [`SendError::Backpressure`](crate::SendError::Backpressure) when
//! the queue is full. VSR retransmits dropped messages from the WAL.
//!
//! Lifecycle: the task exits cleanly when either
//! - the bus shutdown token fires (preferred path during graceful shutdown),
//! - the `Sender` side is dropped/closed (peer unregistered), or
//! - a write to the wire fails (broken connection).
